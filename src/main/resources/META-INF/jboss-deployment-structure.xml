<!--This file will prevent the default services that come with wildfly to be used. We're doing this for two reasons:
1. To avoid the classpath problems - we need to add dependencies to include these in our project though
2. Because the earlier versions of hibernate that came with wf10 had poor spatial support. By excluding the server defaults,
we can use newer versions.-->
